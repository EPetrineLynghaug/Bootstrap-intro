### Basic Setup Steps

1. **Include DOCTYPE and Meta Tags**:  
   Make sure your HTML includes the `DOCTYPE` declaration and the responsive meta tag:
   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
 ``
2.	**Link to Bootstrap CSS and JS**:
Add the following links in your <head> section:
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.3.0/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

3.	**Box-Sizing**:
Set box-sizing to border-box globally:
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}


### Containers and Breakpoints

Bootstrap’s responsive capabilities revolve around containers and breakpoints:

- **Containers**: Center and constrain the content. Types include:
  - `.container`: Fixed-width based on the screen size.
  - `.container-fluid`: Full-width, spanning the entire viewport.
  - `.container-{breakpoint}`: Adjusts according to the specified breakpoint.
- **Breakpoints**: Predefined screen size thresholds to ensure adaptive design.
</details>

### Grid System
<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to read more</strong></summary>

Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system to structure page content, allowing flexible layouts.

- **Basic Structure**: Rows wrap columns, with the total column count in a row equaling 12 for proper alignment:
   ```html
   <div class="row">
       <div class="col-6">Column 1</div>
       <div class="col-6">Column 2</div>
   </div>
   ```

# Flexbox Integration
The grid system is built with flexbox, which offers a powerful way to align and distribute space among elements within a container. Bootstrap also supports the CSS grid, although flexbox is the default.

## Reboot
**Default Styling Reset**  
Bootstrap’s “Reboot” feature resets many default browser styles to provide a consistent foundation. It sets base styling for elements like typography, forms, and buttons to ensure they appear uniformly across different browsers.

## Typography and Text Utilities
<details>

- **Bootstrap offers built-in classes for styling text**:
    - **Font Settings**: Customize font size, family, and weight using classes.
    - **Text Alignment**: Align text using classes like `text-start`, `text-center`, or `text-end`.
    - **Display Headings**: Use classes such as `display-1` to `display-6` for large, impactful headers.
    - **Muted Text**: Apply `text-muted` for subdued text styling.


## Tables

**Bootstrap’s table styling improves default table appearance and adds functionality**:

- **Striped Rows**: `table-striped` for alternating row colors.
- **Dark Theme**: `table-dark` for dark-themed tables.
- **Hover Effect**: `table-hover` to highlight rows on mouseover.


## Forms

Bootstrap’s form components make it easy to create stylish forms:

- **Validation**: Predefined validation states help users submit correct data.
- **Form Layouts**: Supports inline forms, stacked forms, and grid-based layouts.
- **Form Controls**: Includes elements like text inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

## Button Styling

Buttons come with different styling options for various actions:

- **Primary Buttons**: `btn-primary` for primary actions.
- **Outline Buttons**: `btn-outline-secondary` for a less prominent look.
- **Button Sizes**: Use `btn-sm` or `btn-lg` for small or large buttons.
